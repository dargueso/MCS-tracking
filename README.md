# Mesoscale Convective System and Convective storms algorithm.
Optimized version based on A. Prein MCS-tracking.

Adapted to ingest WRF model outputs, or any other netCDF with OLR and Precipitation at any frequency (hourly or 3-hourly is recommended). 
It facilitates computing statistics such as the size of the storm, total volume of precipitation and maximum precipititation rate for each system.
